Litter box issues are one of the most common problems cat owners face, but they can often be solved with the right approach.

## Common Problems
- **Avoidance:** Cats may avoid the litter box if it’s dirty or in a noisy area.  
- **Medical Issues:** Conditions like urinary tract infections can cause inappropriate elimination.  
- **Territorial Behavior:** Multiple cats may need multiple boxes.  

## Solutions
1. Keep the litter box clean — scoop daily and change litter weekly.  
2. Provide at least **one box per cat, plus one extra**.  
3. Experiment with different litter types if your cat is picky.  
4. Place boxes in quiet, accessible locations.

Consistency and patience are key to solving litter box problems.
