# Puppy Training Basics: The First 8 Weeks at Home

Bringing a new puppy home is exciting, but those first eight weeks are critical for setting the foundation of good behavior. Puppies are like sponges during this stage, learning quickly from everything around them.

## Week 1–2: Settling In
- Introduce your puppy to their crate—it becomes their safe space.  
- Begin house training with frequent bathroom breaks (every 2–3 hours).  
- Reward calm behavior with praise and treats.  

## Week 3–4: Building Routines
- Establish consistent feeding and sleeping schedules.  
- Start basic commands: **sit**, **stay**, and **come**.  
- Gentle socialization with new people and environments.  

## Week 5–6: Expanding Skills
- Increase walk lengths gradually.  
- Introduce leash training and practice in quiet areas.  
- Teach "leave it" and "drop it" to prevent unwanted chewing.  

## Week 7–8: Preparing for the Next Stage
- Encourage independence by leaving your puppy alone for short periods.  
- Practice recall with distractions.  
- Continue rewarding positive behavior consistently.
