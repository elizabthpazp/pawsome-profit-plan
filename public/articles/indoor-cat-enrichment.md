Indoor cats can live long and healthy lives, but they need proper enrichment to avoid boredom and stress.

## Why Enrichment Matters
Without stimulation, indoor cats may develop **obesity**, **destructive behavior**, or **anxiety**.

## Enrichment Ideas
- **Interactive Toys:** Puzzle feeders and laser toys encourage natural hunting behavior.  
- **Climbing Spaces:** Cat trees and shelves provide vertical exploration.  
- **Scratching Posts:** Essential for maintaining claw health.  
- **Sensory Stimulation:** Rotate toys and provide safe access to windows.

A stimulating environment leads to a happier, healthier indoor cat.
