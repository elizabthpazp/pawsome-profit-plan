## Common Signs of Food Allergies
- Itchy skin, especially paws, ears, and belly  
- Chronic ear infections  
- Digestive issues (vomiting, diarrhea, or gas)  
- Excessive licking or chewing at the skin  

## What Causes Food Allergies?
The most frequent allergens in dog foods are:  
- Beef  
- Dairy  
- Chicken  
- Wheat and soy  

## Solutions and Management
1. **Elimination Diet** – Remove potential allergens and reintroduce foods slowly.  
2. **Hypoallergenic Dog Food** – Formulated with novel proteins (like venison or duck).
