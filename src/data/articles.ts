**Days 1-2:** 75% old food, 25% new food
**Days 3-4:** 50% old food, 50% new food

# Cat Behavior Decoded: 15 Strange Behaviors Explained

Cats are fascinating creatures with complex behaviors that often leave their human companions puzzled. As a feline behavior specialist, I've spent years studying cat psychology and communication. Understanding these behaviors can strengthen your bond with your cat and help you provide better care.

## 1. Kneading (Making Biscuits)

**What It Looks Like:** Your cat pushes their paws alternately against soft surfaces, often purring while doing so.

**What It Means:** This behavior stems from kittenhood when cats knead their mother's belly to stimulate milk flow. Adult cats knead when they feel content, safe, and happy. It's a sign of affection and comfort.

**When to Worry:** Never. This is always a positive behavior, though the claws can be uncomfortable for humans.

**Management Tip:** Place a thick blanket on your lap to protect yourself while still allowing this bonding behavior.

## 2. Head Bunting and Cheek Rubbing

**What It Looks Like:** Your cat deliberately bumps their head against you or rubs their cheeks on objects and people.

**What It Means:** Cats have scent glands on their heads and cheeks. This behavior marks you and objects with their scent, claiming you as part of their territory. It's also a sign of affection.

**Fun Fact:** The scientific term for this is "allorubbing," and it's how cats show they consider you family.

## 3. Slow Blinking

**What It Looks Like:** Your cat looks at you and deliberately closes their eyes slowly, sometimes called "cat kisses."

**What It Means:** This is a cat's way of saying "I love you" and "I trust you." In cat language, closing eyes in another's presence shows ultimate trust.

**Try This:** Slow blink back at your cat. Many cats will return the gesture, strengthening your bond.

## 4. Chattering at Birds

**What It Looks Like:** Your cat makes rapid clicking or chattering sounds while watching birds through a window.

**What It Means:** This is a hunting behavior. The chattering might be:
- Excitement and frustration at seeing prey they can't reach
- Practice movements for delivering a killing bite
- An involuntary response to hunting instincts

**Normal or Concerning:** Completely normal hunting behavior.

## 5. Bringing You "Gifts"

**What It Looks Like:** Your cat brings you dead (or sometimes live) mice, birds, or toys.

**What It Means:** Your cat considers you part of their family and wants to provide for you. They may also be trying to teach you hunting skills, as mother cats do with their kittens.

**Response:** Thank your cat calmly (don't scold) and dispose of the gift safely. Scolding can damage your relationship.

## 6. Hiding in Boxes and Small Spaces

**What It Looks Like:** Your cat seeks out boxes, drawers, or any enclosed space.

**What It Means:** 
- **Security:** Enclosed spaces provide protection from all sides
- **Temperature regulation:** Small spaces help cats conserve body heat
- **Stress relief:** Hiding helps cats cope with anxiety
- **Hunting advantage:** Ambush predators naturally seek concealment

**When to Worry:** If hiding increases suddenly or your cat won't come out for meals, this could indicate illness or stress.

## 7. Midnight Zoomies

**What It Looks Like:** Sudden bursts of energy where your cat races around the house, often at night.

**What It Means:** This is normal energy release, especially common in:
- Young cats with excess energy
- Indoor cats with limited exercise opportunities
- Cats experiencing joy or excitement

**Management:** Provide more interactive play during the day to reduce nighttime activity.

## 8. Licking You

**What It Looks Like:** Your cat licks your skin, hair, or clothing with their rough tongue.

**What It Means:**
- **Grooming behavior:** Cats groom family members as social bonding
- **Affection:** Similar to how they show love to other cats
- **Claiming:** Marking you with their scent
- **Attention-seeking:** Learning that licking gets your attention

**Note:** Some cats lick more when stressed or anxious.

## 9. Exposing Their Belly

**What It Looks Like:** Your cat rolls over and shows their belly, sometimes while purring.

**What It Means:** This shows extreme trust and contentment. The belly is a cat's most vulnerable area.

**Important:** Unlike dogs, most cats don't want belly rubs. This is a display of trust, not an invitation to touch.

**What to Do:** Appreciate the trust without touching the belly, which might trigger defensive behavior.

## 10. Following You Around

**What It Looks Like:** Your cat shadows you from room to room throughout the day.

**What It Means:**
- **Affection:** They enjoy your company
- **Curiosity:** Interested in your activities
- **Learned behavior:** You provide good things (food, attention, treats)
- **Separation anxiety:** Some cats become anxious when alone

**When to Worry:** If following becomes excessive and accompanied by vocalizing or destructive behavior when you leave.

## 11. Staring at Walls or "Empty" Spaces

**What It Looks Like:** Your cat intensely focuses on seemingly nothing, sometimes with alert body language.

**What It Means:**
- **Superior senses:** Cats can hear and see things we can't (insects in walls, high-frequency sounds)
- **Light patterns:** Detecting subtle changes in light or shadows
- **Scents:** Following scent trails invisible to humans

**When to Worry:** Rarely concerning unless accompanied by other behavioral changes.

## 12. Covering Food

**What It Looks Like:** Your cat makes scratching motions around their food bowl as if burying it.

**What It Means:**
- **Instinctive behavior:** Wild cats bury excess food to hide it from competitors
- **Food saving:** Wanting to return to the food later
- **Cleanliness:** Some cats prefer to "clean up" after eating

**Management:** Normal behavior that doesn't require intervention.

## 13. Excessive Vocalization

**What It Looks Like:** Your cat meows, yowls, or makes other sounds more than usual.

**What It Means:**
- **Communication:** Cats develop unique "languages" with their humans
- **Attention-seeking:** Learned behavior that gets responses
- **Stress or anxiety:** Changes in environment or routine
- **Health issues:** Pain, cognitive dysfunction, or other medical problems

**When to Worry:** Sudden increases in vocalization warrant a veterinary check-up.

## 14. Sitting in the "Loaf" Position

**What It Looks Like:** Your cat sits with all paws tucked under their body, resembling a loaf of bread.

**What It Means:**
- **Comfort:** A relaxed, comfortable position
- **Temperature regulation:** Conserving body heat
- **Alert rest:** Ready to spring into action if needed

**Body Language Note:** This position indicates contentment and security.

## 15. Bringing Toys to Bed

**What It Looks Like:** Your cat carries toys to your bed or their sleeping area.

**What It Means:**
- **Nesting behavior:** Creating a comfortable, familiar environment
- **Hunting simulation:** Bringing "prey" to a safe location
- **Comfort objects:** Some cats form attachments to specific toys
- **Sharing:** Bringing favorite things to their favorite people

## Understanding Cat Body Language

### Tail Positions
- **High and straight:** Confident and happy
- **Puffed up:** Frightened or aggressive
- **Low or tucked:** Anxious or submissive
- **Slow swish:** Content or mildly interested
- **Fast thrashing:** Agitated or overstimulated

### Ear Positions
- **Forward:** Alert and interested
- **Backward:** Anxious or aggressive
- **Flat against head:** Very frightened or aggressive

### Eye Signals
- **Slow blinks:** Affection and trust
- **Wide eyes:** Alert, excited, or fearful
- **Half-closed:** Relaxed and content

## When Cat Behavior Indicates Health Problems

### Sudden Behavioral Changes
- Hiding more than usual
- Changes in appetite or litter box habits
- Increased or decreased vocalization
- Aggression in normally friendly cats
- Loss of interest in play or affection

### Signs Requiring Immediate Veterinary Attention
- Difficulty breathing
- Inability to urinate
- Severe lethargy
- Vomiting or diarrhea lasting more than 24 hours
- Any behavior change accompanied by physical symptoms

## Creating a Cat-Friendly Environment

### Environmental Enrichment
- **Vertical spaces:** Cat trees and shelves
- **Hiding spots:** Boxes and cat caves
- **Window perches:** Views of the outside world
- **Interactive toys:** Puzzle feeders and wand toys
- **Scratching posts:** Multiple textures and heights

### Reducing Stress
- **Consistent routines:** Regular feeding and play times
- **Safe spaces:** Quiet areas where cats can retreat
- **Pheromone diffusers:** Feliway can help anxious cats
- **Gradual changes:** Introduce new things slowly

## Building a Better Relationship with Your Cat

### Do's
- **Respect boundaries:** Let cats approach you
- **Use slow movements:** Sudden movements can startle cats
- **Provide choices:** Allow cats to decide when to interact
- **Reward positive behavior:** Use treats and praise
- **Maintain routines:** Cats feel secure with predictability

### Don'ts
- **Force interactions:** This can damage trust
- **Punish natural behaviors:** Redirect instead of punish
- **Ignore body language:** Learn to read your cat's signals
- **Make sudden changes:** Gradually introduce changes

## Conclusion

Understanding cat behavior is key to building a strong, loving relationship with your feline friend. Remember that each cat is an individual with their own personality and preferences. What's normal for one cat might be unusual for another.

The behaviors we've discussed are typically normal expressions of feline nature. However, sudden changes in behavior, especially when accompanied by physical symptoms, should always be evaluated by a veterinarian.

By learning to "speak cat," you'll not only better understand your pet but also provide them with a more enriching and comfortable life. The more we understand our cats, the better we can meet their physical and emotional needs.

Remember: patience, observation, and respect for your cat's natural instincts will go a long way in creating a harmonious relationship that benefits both you and your feline companion.
