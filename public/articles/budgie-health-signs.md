Budgerigars (budgies) are small, active birds that can hide signs of illness until it becomes serious. Recognizing early symptoms is crucial for their health.

## Warning Signs
- Fluffed-up feathers for long periods.  
- Loss of appetite or weight loss.  
- Changes in droppings (color, consistency, or frequency).  
- Lethargy or reduced activity.  
- Breathing difficulties.  

## When to See a Vet
If any of these signs appear, consult an **avian veterinarian immediately**. Birds can deteriorate rapidly, so early intervention is key.

## Prevention
A proper diet, clean environment, and regular vet checkups will help keep your budgie healthy.
