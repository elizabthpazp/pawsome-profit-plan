The Holland Lop is one of the most popular rabbit breeds due to its small size and gentle nature. Proper care is essential to ensure a long, healthy, and happy life.

## Diet
A balanced diet should include:
- Unlimited **fresh hay** (timothy or orchard grass).  
- A measured amount of high-quality **pellets**.  
- Fresh vegetables daily.  

Avoid sugary treats or excessive fruit.

## Grooming
Holland Lops have dense fur that requires **weekly brushing** to prevent matting. Regular nail trims are also important.

## Housing
Provide a spacious enclosure with plenty of room to hop, stretch, and play. Rabbits thrive with daily out-of-cage exercise.
