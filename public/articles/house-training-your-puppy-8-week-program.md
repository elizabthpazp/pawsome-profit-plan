# House Training Your Puppy: A Complete 8-Week Program

Bringing a new puppy into your home is exciting, but it also comes with a set of challenges — one of the biggest being house training. Teaching your puppy where and when to go to the bathroom is essential for a happy household, and with the right approach, it can be accomplished in just eight weeks.

In this guide, we’ll walk through a week-by-week program to help you set realistic expectations, avoid common mistakes, and create a consistent routine that works for both you and your pup.

## 🐶 Why House Training Matters

House training is about more than just keeping your carpets clean — it’s about teaching your puppy life-long habits. A dog who is properly trained:

* Feels secure in their environment
* Develops trust with their owner
* Avoids unnecessary stress and punishment

The earlier you start, the better. Puppies are learning machines between 8–16 weeks old, making this the ideal window to establish bathroom routines.

## 📅 Week-by-Week Training Program

### Week 1: Setting the Foundation

* **Create a schedule:** Puppies need to go outside every 2–3 hours, plus after meals, naps, and playtime.
* **Choose a potty spot:** Always take your puppy to the same location to help them associate the area with elimination.
* **Use positive reinforcement:** Reward immediately with praise and treats when they go in the right place.
* **Supervision is key:** If you can’t watch your puppy, they should be in a crate or small playpen.

👉 Common mistake: Punishing accidents. Puppies don’t understand punishment — it only creates fear.

### Week 2: Building Consistency

* Track patterns: Write down when your puppy typically needs to go.
* Gradually introduce crate training: Dogs naturally avoid soiling their sleeping space.
* Begin using verbal cues like “Go potty.”

### Week 3: Extending Intervals

* Start increasing the time between potty breaks (3–4 hours during the day).
* Reward calm crate behavior — never use the crate as punishment.
* Introduce short alone times to prevent separation anxiety.

### Week 4: Troubleshooting Accidents

* Expect occasional setbacks — puppies are still learning.
* Clean accidents with enzymatic cleaners to remove odor completely.
* If accidents are frequent, go back to shorter potty intervals.

### Week 5: Reinforcing Good Habits

* Puppies should now signal (whining, scratching) when they need to go out.
* Increase distraction levels: take your pup outside when other dogs or people are around.
* Continue rewarding successes immediately.

### Week 6: Strengthening Independence

* Your puppy should be able to hold it overnight (6–7 hours).
* Allow more supervised freedom in the house.
* Begin reducing treats gradually while still offering praise.

### Week 7: Transitioning Toward Adulthood

* Focus on consistency. Your pup should now understand the routine.
* Address any lingering issues: submissive urination, marking, or excitement peeing.
* Maintain patience — some breeds take longer than others.

### Week 8: Graduation 🎓

* Most puppies will now be reliably house trained.
* Continue reinforcing positive behavior.
* Celebrate milestones — you’ve both worked hard!
