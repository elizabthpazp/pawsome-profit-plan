Arthritis is one of the most common conditions affecting senior pets, but early detection makes management easier.

## Early Signs
- Stiffness after rest  
- Reluctance to climb stairs or jump  
- Limping or favoring a limb  
- Behavioral changes (irritability, less active)  

## Management
- **Weight control** to reduce stress on joints.  
- **Joint supplements** like glucosamine and chondroitin.  
- **Low-impact exercise** such as swimming or short walks.  
- **Veterinary pain management** when needed.  

With the right care, pets with arthritis can maintain a high quality of life.
