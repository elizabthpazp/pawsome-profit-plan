The Maine Coon, often called the "gentle giant" of the cat world, is one of the largest and most affectionate domestic cat breeds. Known for their tufted ears, bushy tails, and friendly nature, these cats require specific care to thrive.

## Grooming
Maine Coons have long, thick fur that can easily mat if not brushed regularly. A **weekly grooming routine** will help prevent tangles and reduce shedding.

## Health
This breed is generally healthy but can be prone to **hip dysplasia** and **hypertrophic cardiomyopathy**. Regular veterinary check-ups are essential.

## Nutrition
Due to their large size, Maine Coons need a **high-protein diet** to maintain muscle mass and energy levels.

## Exercise
Provide climbing structures, toys, and interactive playtime to keep them physically and mentally stimulated.
