Syrian hamsters need a safe, stimulating, and spacious habitat to live comfortably.

## Cage Size
The minimum recommended size is **450 sq. inches of floor space**, but bigger is always better. Multi-level cages are not ideal since hamsters can fall and get injured.

## Bedding
Use **aspen shavings**, paper-based bedding, or hemp. Avoid cedar or pine due to respiratory risks.

## Essentials
- A solid **exercise wheel** (at least 8 inches).  
- **Hideouts** for sleeping and security.  
- Chew toys to maintain healthy teeth.  
- A sand bath for grooming.  

A proper setup ensures your hamster lives a healthy and enriched life.
